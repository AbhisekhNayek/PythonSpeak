# Text-to-Speech using Microsoft SAPI and Python

This Python script demonstrates how to use the Microsoft Speech API (SAPI) to convert text into speech using the `win32com.client` module. It provides a simple function that takes a text input and utilizes the SAPI to make the computer speak out the provided text.

## Prerequisites

- Windows operating system
- Python (3.x recommended)
- `pywin32` library (install using `pip install pywin32`)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the script [`speak.py`](./speak.py).
2. Install the required library by running: `pip install pywin32`.
3. Run the script using a Python interpreter:

   ```bash
   python speak.py
   ```

4. The script will make your computer speak the provided text ("Hello i am abhi" in this case).

## Code Explanation

The script [`speak.py`](./speak.py) contains a function `speak` that uses the `win32com.client` module to interact with the SAPI. The function takes a string as input and converts it into speech using the default voice.
